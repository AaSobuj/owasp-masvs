## Contribute Online

GitHub makes this extremely easy.

For small changes in one file:

1. Go to the file you'd like to modify and click on "Edit"
2. Do your changes and commit them. GitHub will guide you and suggest to open a Pull Request.

For more complex changes or across files:

1. Simply click "." anywhere on the repo.
2. You'll be welcomed with a "GitHub Codespace" where you can work using an online Visual Studio.
3. Do your changes, commit and push them as you'd do locally.

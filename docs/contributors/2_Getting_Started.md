## Contribute Online

GitHub makes this extremely easy.

For small changes in one file:

1. Go to the file you'd like to modify and [click on "Edit"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files#editing-files-in-another-users-repository).
2. Do your changes and commit them. GitHub will guide you and suggest to open a Pull Request.

For more complex changes or across files:

1. Press `.` while browsing the repo or pull request.
2. You'll be welcomed with a ["github.dev Web-based Editor"](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) where you can work using an online Visual Studio.
3. Do your [changes, commit and push](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor#using-source-control) them as you'd do locally.
